# **My first App using Android Studio**

This App convert km into m, and vice-versa. 

It contains 3 Activities:

  - main: where the users decide whether they want to convert km --> m or  m --> km
  
  - km into m: the users input a float number and after clicking the Convert button, the result shows up in a plain text output (m = km * 1000).
  
  - m into km: the users input a float number and after clicking the Convert button, the result shows up in a plain text output (km = m / 1000).
